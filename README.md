This project focuses on predicting stock price trends by integrating historical stock data from Yahoo Finance with sentiment analysis of financial news headlines. The goal is to enhance traditional time-series forecasting by incorporating public sentiment as an external factor influencing market behavior. The model uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network to capture temporal dependencies in stock price movements, while sentiment scores—derived using tools like VADER or TextBlob—are used to enrich the input features. The final output visualizes predicted stock trends against actual prices, demonstrating how combining market data with textual sentiment can improve prediction performance. This project showcases the intersection of financial data science, natural language processing, and deep learning.
